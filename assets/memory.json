  "summary": "Tristan prefers concise Java using arrays or varargs, dislikes tuple unpacking, and wants neatly formatted Java output. He enjoys music such as \"Bella Ciao,\" often listens to songs on repeat, and seeks Spotify playlists that are war-themed, aesthetic, and pessimistic. He values playlist recommendations in that style. His active to-dos include work on contextual memory for AI, vector embedding, prompt cooldown functionality, and lowering the silence threshold for voice recording. Computer recently played a war-themed, aesthetic, pessimistic playlist on Spotify as requested, skipped a track at Tristanâ€™s command, and now is playing a \"Vietnam War songs\" playlist upon his latest request. Last exchange: User:  Can you please play Vietnam War songs on Spotify? Computer: [{\"module\": \"speak\", \"args\": { \"text\": \"Playing Vietnam War songs on Spotify.\" }}, {\"module\": \"spotify\", \"args\": { \"action\": \"play\", \"search\": \"Vietnam War songs\" } }]"
